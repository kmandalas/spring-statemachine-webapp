# Multi-Step Process with Spring Boot & Spring State Machine

This branch implements a **dynamic, UI-driven multi-step process** using **Spring Boot** and **Spring State Machine** (➕ with machine state & context persistence enabled),
allowing for configurable workflows and seamless state transitions. The backend utilizes **PostgreSQL with JSONB support** to efficiently store form data.

The project serves as a demonstration for the requirements outlined in my DZone article
[Dynamic Forms With Camunda and Spring StateMachine](https://dzone.com/articles/dynamic-forms-camunda-spring-statemachine).
